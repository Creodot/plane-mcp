> A [Model Context Protocol (MCP)](https://modelcontextprotocol.io/) server acting as a bridge to the [Plane.so API](https://developers.plane.so/api-reference/introduction). üöÄ

This server allows MCP clients (like AI assistants or other tools) to interact with Plane.so resources (initially Issues) through defined tools.

## üë§ For Users

This section provides information for users who want to install and run the Plane.so MCP server to connect it with their MCP client (e.g., Cursor, Claude App).

### ‚≠ê Available Tools

The server exposes the following tools to interact with the Plane.so API. Tool names use underscores (e.g., `plane_get_issue`).

#### `plane_get_issue`

Retrieves details of a specific issue.

**Parameters:**

*   `project_id` (string, required): ID of the project containing the issue.
*   `issue_id` (string, required): ID of the issue to retrieve.

**Example:**

```json
{
  "project_id": "your_project_id_here",
  "issue_id": "your_issue_id_here"
}
```

#### `plane_create_issue`

Creates a new issue in a specified project.

**Parameters:**

*   `project_id` (string, required): ID of the project where the issue should be created.
*   `name` (string, required): Title of the issue.
*   `description_html` (string, optional): HTML description of the issue (Plane API often requires this format).
*   `priority` (string, optional): Priority of the issue ("urgent", "high", "medium", "low", "none").
*   `state_id` (string, optional): ID of the state for this issue.
*   `assignees` (array<string>, optional): Array of user IDs to assign to this issue.

**Example:**

```json
{
  "project_id": "your_project_id_here",
  "name": "New Feature Request",
  "description_html": "<p>Details about the new feature.</p>",
  "priority": "medium"
}
```

#### `plane_update_issue`

Updates an existing issue in a project.

**Parameters:**

*   `project_id` (string, required): ID of the project containing the issue.
*   `issue_id` (string, required): ID of the issue to update.
*   `name` (string, optional): Updated title of the issue.
*   `description_html` (string, optional): Updated HTML description of the issue.
*   `priority` (string, optional): Updated priority of the issue.
*   `state_id` (string, optional): Updated state ID of the issue.
*   `assignees` (array<string>, optional): Updated array of user IDs assigned to this issue.

**Example:**

```json
{
  "project_id": "your_project_id_here",
  "issue_id": "your_issue_id_here",
  "priority": "high",
  "assignees": ["user_id_1"]
}
```

### ‚úÖ Prerequisites

*   [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) (v20 or higher recommended)
*   [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/)
*   A Plane.so account and an API Key -> Workspace Icon (top left) -> Settings -> API Tokens -> Add API Token
*   Plane.so Workspace slug -> `https://app.plane.so/{workspace_slug}/` (Replace `{workspace_slug}` with your actual workspace slug)

### üõ†Ô∏è Installation

1.  Clone the repository:
    ```bash
    # Replace with your fork or the main repo URL
    git clone https://github.com/Creodot/plane-mcp.git
    cd plane-mcp
    ```
2.  Install dependencies:
    ```bash
    npm install
    ```

### ‚öôÔ∏è Configuration

Create a `.env` file in the root of the project and add your Plane.so API Key and Workspace Slug:

```dotenv
# .env
PLANE_API_KEY=your_plane_api_key_here
PLANE_WORKSPACE_SLUG=your_workspace_slug_here

# Optional: Specify if you are using a self-hosted Plane instance
# PLANE_API_BASE_URL=https://your-self-hosted-plane.com/api/v1
```

üîë Replace `your_plane_api_key_here` with your actual API key.
üîë Replace `your_workspace_slug_here` with your actual workspace slug.

### üöÄ Usage

1.  **Build the project:**
    ```bash
    npm run build
    ```

2.  **Start the server:**
    ```bash
    npm start
    ```

The server will start and listen for requests on its standard input (stdin) and send responses to its standard output (stdout). You need to configure your MCP client (like Cursor, Claude App, etc.) to launch this server process when needed.

For more details on the Model Context Protocol, visit [modelcontextprotocol.io](https://modelcontextprotocol.io/).

### ‚ú® Examples

Here are some example prompts you could give your AI assistant (once the server is configured in it):

*   "Get the details for issue `BUG-123` in the `WebApp` project."
*   "Create a new high-priority issue in the `API` project titled 'Refactor authentication module' with the description 'Need to update the auth library.'"
*   "Update issue `FEAT-45` in the `Design` project and assign it to `user_abc`."

Your assistant will use the appropriate tools (`plane_get_issue`, `plane_create_issue`, `plane_update_issue`) and likely ask for your confirmation before making changes.

### üõ°Ô∏è Security Considerations

*   **API Key Security:** Your `PLANE_API_KEY` stored in the `.env` file grants access to your Plane.so workspace. Keep this file secure and never commit it to version control.
*   **Permissions:** Ensure the API key used has the necessary permissions within Plane.so to perform the actions required by the tools (e.g., read issues, create issues, update issues).
*   **User Approval:** Most MCP clients will require your explicit approval before executing actions that modify data (like creating or updating issues), providing a safety layer.

## üßë‚Äçüíª For Developers

This section is for developers who want to contribute to the project, run tests, or use the development environment.

### Development üßë‚Äçüíª

To run the server in development mode with automatic rebuilding and restarting on file changes (thanks to `node --watch`):

```bash
npm run dev
```

### Testing üß™

Run the full test suite:

```bash
npm test
```

Run tests in watch mode during development:

```bash
npm run test:watch
```

### Linting and Formatting ‚ú®

Check for linting and formatting errors using Biome:

```bash
npm run lint
npm run format:check
```

Apply formatting and lint fixes automatically:

```bash
npm run format
```

(Note: Formatting is also automatically applied on commit via Husky and lint-staged!)
